# Starter Kit for Apollo GraphQL in ExpressJS

The goal of this project is to create a ready-to-go basic kit of Apollo Server for Express. It is still in development. 

The project uses these libraries:

## Implemented Libraries
1. **apollo-server-express**: This express integration is used because it is the integration mentioned in the Apollo website.
2. **Mongoose (Mongo DB)**: This is the library for modeling the app data. You can read all about it [here](http://mongoosejs.com/)
3. **Authentication Feature**: User Authentication is one of the most preliminary feature of any application unless the application is completely private. I am going to use [JWToken](https://jwt.io/) and [Bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) for authentication.

## In Progress
1. Client App

## Pre requisites
1. NodeJS: Download for Mac or Windows from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
